1) Ask if the player would like to play blackjack.
2) If yes, ask the player their name.
3) Start the player off with a starting balance of x chips.

4) Establish a 'shuffled' deck of cards. 
      - can establish data set of values, and then separate set of suits and join them somehow to produce an array of 52 cards.
      - can use a shuffle function to then 'shuffle the deck'.
      - establish count of cards remaining in deck.
      - Aces need to be worth 1 or 11 depending on value

4.5) Insert:  Ask player how much they would like to bet.
      - must be below player balance but greater than zero.
      
5) Establish a method for dealing the initial cards.
       - if player is dealt blackjack, they automatically win 1.5 times their bet.
       - update count of cards remaining in deck
       - update player balance

6) Ask the player if they'd like to hit or stay.
      - if number < 21 then ask again looping until player stays or busts
      - player automatically loses if hand > 21
      - if player stays AND hand is 21 or less, then dealer plays
      
7) If dealer hand is < 17 dealer hits
      - repeat if dealer hand is still < 17
      - if dealer hand >= 17 or <= 21, dealer stays
      - if dealer hand > 21, dealer automatically loses
      
8) if both player and dealer stay on numbers <= 21
      - evaluate both hands
      - if player > dealer...player wins 1x their bet
      - if dealer > player...player loses bet
      - if dealer = player...it's a push and player keeps bet.
      - update player balance
      
9) ask if player would like to play another hand
      - if yes, and remaining card count is greater than > x, repeat from step 4.5
      - if yes, and remaining card count is <= x, repeate from step 4
      - if no, exit program.
